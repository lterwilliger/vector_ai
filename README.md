# Vectorized Language State Project

This project explores token-free generation and vectorized language state concepts, focusing on continuous semantic representations rather than discrete token-based approaches.

## Project Goals

- Implement and experiment with continuous vector representations of language
- Explore semantic composition in vector space
- Investigate token-free generation approaches
- Compare different embedding strategies and their effectiveness

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
